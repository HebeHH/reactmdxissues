# Imported markdown

## Latex

Here is some Latex: $$\frac{1}{e-x}$$.

The Latex will show properly in the "plain" markdown page, and the "imported". However, in the "remote" version, it throws an error - `Error: e is not defined` - and the page doesn't show. I have no idea why this only happens when using "next-mdx-remote".

## Footnotes

Single string [^1] and longer string footnotes behave differently.

Any `singleString` footnotes will successfully create a footnote reference[^2]. The first two footnotes create a link, as will this one. [^3] This will link to a _page_ `domain/singleString`.

This is very much not the expected behaviour. I expect a footnote to create the footnote string at the bottom of the page, with a clickable link between those two locations.

However, as soon as I insert a longer footnote [^4], all footnotes stop working at all. Even subsequent single string footnotes [^5] stop working. Subsequent longer strings [^6] have no hope. They're just treated as plain text.

If the first footnote is a long string, no footnotes will work

[^1]: singleString
[^2]: anotherSingleString
[^3]: test
[^4]: a longer test footnote
[^5]: AFailedSingleString
[^6]: Another long footnote
