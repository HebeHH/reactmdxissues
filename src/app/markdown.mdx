# Help needed! MDX, React, footnotes and Latex ðŸ˜¢

I am deeply confused by the way footnotes and Latex are working in MDX React. This is a cry for help.

My expectation was that React and markdown are both established enough technologies that they would kinda work. Footnotes and latex aren't exactly edge cases either. Unfortunately, footnotes are failing entirely and latex won't work remote.

I'm pretty inexperienced at frontend so would appreciate help.
